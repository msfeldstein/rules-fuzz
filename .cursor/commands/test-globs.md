We are testing out prompt inclusion. Follow these instrucitons exaclty step by step and dont get clever.

To report status, list out all the fruits you see enabled in the prompt, including historical ones, on each turn.  Its very important you mention all the ones you've seen.

Step 1 (Global Context):
Say "Testing Global Rules:" and then report status

Step 2 (Matching root glob from root)
Say "Testing matching glob from root", readFile "./root.ts" then report status

Step 3 (Matching root glob from nested)
Say "Testing root glob from nested file", readFile "./components/app.js" then report status
